description: An unflinching portrait of an unhappy marriage, A Modern Instance examines
  a couple's personal conflicts as the effects of commercial progress and rapid changes
  in social and religious institutions. Howells's novel ends with the hero barred
  by his over-scrupulous conscience from marrying the divorced heroine.
